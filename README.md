# Project name

The UAP's ontology, an [UAP initiative](https://www.uap-initiative.org) project.

# Description

In order to share ufological data and enhance softwares interoperability we need
to define a common language. This project aims to define an ontology which
describes ufology's domain, particular UAP's sightings.

By formalising the concepts involved in those sightings, we are pursuing two
goals : 

1. develop and accurate the [data recording model
   (DRM)](https://uap-initiative.github.io/drm/), particular the table structure
   that will be used by our application;
2. provide a framework for publishing data as queryable Web linked data.

The project consists of 

- building the ontology itself using Protégé[^1] ;
- writing the related documentation using LODE[^2] [^3].

# Installation

We propose to work with [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to build
ontology and with [LODE](https://essepuntato.it/lode/) to produce documentation.

# Usage

Edit `*.owl` files with Protégé version 5.5.0 or later.

You can *locally* generate :

- `*.html` pages from `*.owl` files using LODE.
- `*.html` pages from `*.md` files using Pandoc.

For more details about these apps usage, please refer to their documentation.
Here is some direct links :

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/docs.php)
- [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/)
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html)
- [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- [LODE](https://essepuntato.it/lode/)
