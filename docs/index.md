# Project name

The UAP's ontology, an [UAP initiative](https://www.uap-initiative.org) project.

# Description

In order to share ufological data and enhance softwares interoperability we need
to define a common language. This project aims to define an ontology which
describes ufology's domain, particular UAP's sightings.

By formalising the concepts involved in those sightings, we are pursuing two
goals : 

1. develop and accurate the [data recording model
   (DRM)](https://uap-initiative.github.io/drm/), particular the table structure
   that will be used by our application;
2. provide a framework for publishing data as queryable Web linked data.

The project consists of 

- building the ontology itself using Protégé[^1] ;
- writing the related documentation using LODE[^2] [^3].
